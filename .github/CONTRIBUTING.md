# Contributing to SpigotPaginatedGUI
Contributions are welcome.  
Those who offer many valuable contributions to the project will be invited to actively contribute to the project.  

## Code Requirements
* Please add meaningful comments to your code, however, don't submit code with meaningless comments.
* Please follow standard Java programming conventions, such as lowerCamelCase for variable names, upperCamelCase for class names,
opening method curly brackets on the same line as the definition, etc.
```java
/* DO: */
public void doSomething(){
  // ...
}

/* DON'T */
public void doSomething()
{
  // ...
}
```
* Finally, please use meaningful commit names. For example, rather than just stating added `MyFile.java`,
state `Fixed #<issue>` or `Implemented <new feature>`.

## Behavioural Expectations
* Please don't commit comments (and especially not debug statements) with swear/curse words in them.
    * In fact, it's probably a good idea to just not put swear/curse words in your code in the first place, as they can occasionally slip through.

## Note
Please feel free to contact me if you have any issues with these guidelines/requirements.  
This is my first time managing a true open source community project.
