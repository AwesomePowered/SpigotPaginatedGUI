## Todo List
* Make button listener an interface.
	* Remove button listener altogether and make it a consumer interface
* Builder pattern for creating a menu
	* "Have a separate builder for all the buttons and menus so it can be done in one neat statement. Try that as a challenge."
* "Look through all the new interfaces implemented in Java 8 (like the consumer interface) and try to see if you can use them in any way"
